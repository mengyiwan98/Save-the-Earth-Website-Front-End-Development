# Description of My Project

- A React-based Single-Page Application(SPA) about a topic of saving the earth. The project built for a reminder of protecting our earth. Users can sign up their accounts and enjoy the services we provide to improve their knowledge of how to save water, energy, and reduce carbon. 
- The website has 5 views
    - "Home" - a view that show the name of the website
    - "Service" - describes the main issue of saving the earth 
    - "About" - a view that describes the topic or purpose of the website
    - "Privacy" - a privacy policy
    - "Sign" - Sign up form
- Navbar allows the user to switch between views

# Complex UI elements

- Carousel built in the view of "Service", which shows three images
- Accodion built in the view of "About". It describes three aspects, including importance of saving earth, our vision for change, and things you can do to help protect the earth.

# Loading Indicator

- Add a loading indicator in the view of sign-up. When the users finish the sign-up form, there will be a loading indicator, and then they can get "Thank you".
